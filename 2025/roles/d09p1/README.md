# Day 9: Part 1

## Instructions

You have input like this:

```
3,2
9,2
9,5
6,5
6,8
1,8
1,4
3,4
```

Each line represents the position of a **red tile** in a grid like this (where
`0,0` is the top-left corner):

```
..............
..............
...#.....#....
..............
.#.#..........
......#..#....
..............
..............
.#....#.......
..............
```

You can make a rectangle by choosing two red tiles as opposite corners. For
example, `3,4` and `6,5` can make a rectangle like this:

```
..............
..............
...#.....#....
..............
.#.#OOO.......
...OOO#..#....
..............
..............
.#....#.......
..............
```

_Q: What is the area of the largest rectangle you can make?

## Notes

The naive approach is to just to iterate through every possible combination of
tiles, calculate the areas, and take the largest.

But that's a lot of iterations and we can do better! So my approach was to:

- give each tile scores based on how close they are to each corner of the grid:
    - `top_left_score`
    - `top_right_score`
    - `bottom_left_score`
    - `bottom_right_score`
- draw the largest rectangle possible where none of its sides are closer to any
  edge of the grid than any highest scoring tiles
- for example, if `#` are our highest scoring tiles, we can draw this rectangle:

    ```
    ................
    ...#............
    ................
    .#.OOOOOOOOOO.#.
    ...O........O...
    ...O........O...
    ...O........O...
    ...OOOOOOOOOO#..
    ...#............
    ................
    ```

- eliminate all tiles that are inside or on the border of this inner rectangle
  (except our highest scoring tiles)
- iterate through every combination of the (very few) remaining tiles to find
  the largest area
