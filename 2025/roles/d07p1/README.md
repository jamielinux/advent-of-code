# Day 7: Part 1

## Instructions

You have input like this:

```
.......S.......
...............
.......^.......
...............
......^.^......
...............
.....^...^.....
...............
....^...^.^....
...............
...^......^....
...............
..^..^...^..^..
...............
```

- The tachyon beam (`|`) starts at `S` and moves downwards.
- If it hits a splitter (`^`) then the beam is split on either side.
- If two beams overlap, they combine into one beam.
- Assumptions that aren't in the original instructions:
    - Splitters cannot be in adjacent cells.
    - There is always exactly one empty row in between rows with splitters.

In this example, the beam is split 12 times:

```
.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
......|.|......
.....|^|^|.....
.....|.|.|.....
....|^|||^|....
....|..||.|....
...|^|.|^|^|...
...|.|.|.|.|...
..|^||.|.|^|...
..|.||.|.|.|...
.|^||^|||^||^..
.|.||.|||.||...
```

_Q: How many times will the beam be split?_

## Notes

My approach was to:

- parse the input into a list (rows) of lists (cells with a single character)
    - the rows of only dots are redundant, so drop these
- store beam positions as a list of column indexes
- iterate through each row:
    - when encountering a splitter:
        - update beam positions (move to either side of it)
        - increment solution
